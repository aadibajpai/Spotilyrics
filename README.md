Hey there, Spotilyrics is a quick python program that displays the lyrics of the currently playing song.

To use it, please make sure to have Python 3 installed.

Also, install the following libraries if you have not, these libraries were created by other developers on GitHub, 
which were extremely useful and I take abosultely no credit for their work.

Libraries used were from:  
[SwagLyrics](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify) to get the lyrics of the song  
[SwSpotify](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify) to get the artist and song title  

To try it out, make sure to install the following    
```
pip install swaglyrics  
pip install SwSpotify  
```  

After that, run
```
python test.py  
```
and you're good to go!

This is a very simple starting project for me to get used to using GitHub and to explore the ingenuity of the community here.
Thanks!
